# LabStation - Advanced Lab Resource Management

LabStation is a comprehensive web application designed to streamline the management and booking of laboratory resources. It provides a user-friendly interface for researchers, technicians, and lab managers to efficiently discover, reserve, and track the usage of lab equipment and facilities. The system incorporates role-based access control, detailed resource cataloging, an intelligent booking engine, and administrative tools for robust lab operations.

## Core Features

*   **User Management & Authentication:**
    *   Secure **Email/Password Authentication** powered by Firebase.
    *   User **Signup** with an admin approval workflow.
    *   User **Login** and persistent sessions.
    *   **User Profiles:** Users can view and manage their basic profile information (e.g., update name) and a mock password change UI.
    *   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Predefined roles (Admin, Technician, Researcher) with UI elements and actions conditionally rendered based on user role.
*   **Resource Catalog & Management (Admin):**
    *   Add, edit, view, and delete detailed information for lab resources (e.g., oscilloscopes, power supplies, soldering stations).
    *   Resource operational status: 'Working', 'Maintenance', 'Broken'.
    *   Categorize resources using customizable **Resource Types**.
    *   Store manufacturer, model, serial number, purchase date, and general notes.
    *   Manage **Remote Host Integration** details (IP/DNS, protocol, credentials) for remotely accessible equipment.
*   **Advanced Booking Engine:**
    *   Users can create, view, modify, and cancel bookings for available resources.
    *   **Conflict Detection:** Prevents double-bookings by checking against:
        *   Other existing bookings.
        *   Resource-specific one-off unavailability periods (maintenance, etc.).
        *   Lab-wide specific blackout dates.
        *   Lab-wide weekly recurring unavailability rules.
    *   **Availability Scheduling:**
        *   Admins can define resource-specific unavailability periods (e.g., for maintenance). Resource must be in 'Working' status to be bookable.
        *   Manage lab-wide **Blackout Dates** (specific holidays or closure days).
        *   Define lab-wide **Recurring Unavailability Rules** (e.g., lab closed on weekends).
    *   **Queue Management (Basic):**
        *   Resources can be configured to allow waitlisting.
        *   If a slot is full, users can join a waitlist.
        *   Bookings are automatically promoted from the waitlist (to 'Pending' status) when a conflicting confirmed booking is cancelled or rejected by an admin.
        *   Users can see their position in the waitlist (if this UI is implemented).
    *   **Booking Approval Workflow (Admin):** New booking requests enter a 'Pending' state and require approval from an Admin before being confirmed.
*   **Maintenance Requests:**
    *   Log service issues for specific resources.
    *   Admins/Technicians can assign requests, update status (Open, In Progress, Resolved, Closed), and add resolution notes.
*   **Notifications:**
    *   In-app **Notification Center** to alert users about:
        *   Booking confirmations, rejections, and pending approvals.
        *   Promotion from a waitlist.
        *   New maintenance requests or status updates.
        *   Signup approvals.
        *   Lab access request status updates (approved, rejected, revoked).
*   **Usage Logging:**
    *   After a booking is completed, users can log usage details: actual start/end times, outcome (Success, Failure, Interrupted), data storage location, and comments.
*   **Reporting & Analytics (Admin):**
    *   Visual dashboard with charts for:
        *   Bookings per resource.
        *   Maintenance request status distribution.
        *   Resource utilization (conceptual, based on booked days).
        *   Peak booking hours.
        *   Current waitlist sizes.
*   **Audit Logging (Admin):**
    *   Tracks key system events and actions for administrative review.
*   **Lab Operations Center (Admin):**
    *   Centralized management for Labs, Resource Types, Lab Closures (Blackout Dates & Recurring Rules), Maintenance Requests (admin view), and Lab Access Requests.
    *   Context-driven interface to manage system-wide settings or focus on specific lab operations.
*   **Lab & Membership Management:**
    *   Admins can manage **Labs** (CRUD operations for lab entities: name, location, description).
    *   Admins can manage **Resource Types** (CRUD operations for resource categories).
    *   Users can request access to specific labs.
    *   Admins can approve or reject lab access requests.
    *   Admins can manually grant or revoke lab access for users.
    *   Users can leave labs they are members of.

## Getting Started (Local Development)

### Prerequisites

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 18.x or later recommended)
*   npm or yarn
*   A Firebase project

### Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd <project-directory-name>
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install # or yarn install
    npm install firebase-admin # ensure firebase-admin is installed
    ```

3.  **Set up Firebase:**
    *   Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project (or use an existing one).
    *   **Enable Authentication:** In your Firebase project, go to "Authentication" -> "Sign-in method" and enable the "Email/Password" provider.
    *   **Enable Firestore:** In your Firebase project, go to "Firestore Database" -> "Create database". Start in **Test Mode** for development (remember to secure rules for production). Choose a location.
    *   **Register your Web App:** In Project Overview, click the Web icon (`</>`) to add your app. Get the `firebaseConfig` object.
    *   **Service Account for Admin SDK (CRITICAL for server-side functions like notifications/audit logs):**
        *   Go to Project Settings > Service accounts.
        *   Click "Generate new private key" and download the JSON file. This file contains sensitive credentials. **Store this file securely and DO NOT commit it to your Git repository.**
        *   Note the absolute path to this file on your system.

4.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    *   Create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project by copying `.env.local.example` (if it exists, otherwise create it).
    *   Fill in your Firebase project's configuration values from the `firebaseConfig` object (for client-side Firebase):
        ```env
        NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
        NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_auth_domain
        NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
        NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_storage_bucket
        NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_messaging_sender_id
        NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
        NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=your_measurement_id # Optional
        ```
    *   **For Firebase Admin SDK (Server-Side Operations):** Choose **ONE** of the following methods:
        *   **Option A (Recommended for local dev - File Path):**
            Set `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` to the **absolute path** of the service account JSON file you downloaded.
            ```env
            # Example for GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS (replace with your actual path)
            # macOS/Linux: /Users/yourname/path/to/your-service-account-file.json
            # Windows: C:\\Users\\yourname\\path\\to\\your-service-account-file.json
            GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/path/to/your/serviceAccountKey.json"
            ```
        *   **Option B (JSON Content):**
            If file paths are problematic, you can set `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_JSON` to the *entire JSON content* of the service account key file.
            ```env
            # Example for FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_JSON (paste the JSON content as a single line or ensure your environment handles multi-line)
            # FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_JSON='{"type": "service_account", ...}'
            ```
            The `src/lib/firebase-admin.ts` is configured to prioritize `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_JSON` if both are set.
    *   **Important:** Add `.env.local` to your `.gitignore` file to prevent committing your Firebase credentials.

5.  **Seed Initial Admin User (Important!):**
    *   In the **Firebase Console > Authentication > Users** tab, click "Add user" and create your admin user (e.g., `admin@labstation.com` with a password). Note down the UID of this user.
    *   In the **Firebase Console > Firestore Database > Data** tab:
        *   Click "+ Start collection", name it `users`.
        *   Click "+ Add document". For the **Document ID**, paste the **UID** of the admin user you just created.
        *   Add the following fields to this document:
            *   `name`: (Your Admin's Name, e.g., "Admin User") - Type: string
            *   `email`: (Your Admin's Email) - Type: string
            *   `role`: "Admin" - Type: string
            *   `status`: "active" - Type: string
            *   `avatarUrl`: "https://placehold.co/100x100.png" - Type: string
            *   `createdAt`: (Current timestamp) - Type: timestamp
    *   **Security Rules:** Update your Firestore security rules. Go to **Firestore Database > Rules** tab and replace the default rules with the following comprehensive version. **Review and adapt these rules for your production security needs.**
        ```firestore-rules
        rules_version = '2';

        service cloud.firestore {
          match /databases/{database}/documents {

            // Helper function to check if a user is an Admin

6.  **Firestore Indexes:**
    *   **Note on Automatic Single-Field Indexes:** Firestore automatically creates single-field indexes for every field (both ascending and descending). You do not need to manually create these.
    *   **Note on `__name__` in Indexes:** Firestore may automatically append `__name__ (asc)` or `__name__ (desc)` to composite index definitions for internal consistency and tie-breaking, especially when suggested via an error link in the console. This is normal, and you should typically accept it.
    *   **Proactively create these essential COMPOSITE indexes** in the Firebase console. Firestore might prompt for others if specific query patterns are not covered.

        *   **`users` collection:**
            *   `role (Ascending), name (Ascending)`
                *   *Purpose: For filtering users by role and sorting them by name (e.g., in admin user lists, technician dropdowns).*

        *   **`bookings` collection:**
            *   `userId (Ascending), startTime (Ascending)`
                *   *Purpose: For users to view their own bookings, sorted by start time (My Bookings page).*
            *   `userId (Ascending), endTime (Ascending), startTime (Ascending)`
                 *   *Purpose: Critical for dashboard query of user's upcoming bookings (`where('userId', '==', ...).where('endTime', '>=', ...).orderBy('startTime', 'asc')`).*
            *   `resourceId (Ascending), status (Ascending), startTime (Ascending)`
                *   *Purpose: For viewing bookings for a specific resource, filtered by status, and ordered by start time (e.g., on admin booking requests page if filtered by resource).*
            *   `resourceId (Ascending), status (Ascending), endTime (Ascending), startTime (Ascending)`
                *   *Purpose: Critical for booking conflict checks (`where('resourceId', ...).where('status', 'in', ...).where('startTime', '<', ...).where('endTime', '>', ...)`).*
            *   `status (Ascending), startTime (Ascending)`
                *   *Purpose: For admin views of booking requests, filtered by status and sorted by start time.*
            *   `resourceId (Ascending), status (Ascending), createdAt (Ascending)`
                *   *Purpose: For processing waitlists in FIFO order for a specific resource.*
            *   `resourceId (Ascending), userId (Ascending), startTime (Descending)`
                *   *Purpose: For `src/app/resources/[resourceId]/page.tsx` to fetch user's past bookings for a specific resource.*
            *   `userId (Ascending), endTime (Ascending)` (*Adjusted, startTime Desc might be better depending on final upcoming booking query*)
                *   *Purpose: For dashboard query of user's upcoming bookings (`where('userId', '==', ...).where('endTime', '>=', ...).orderBy('startTime', 'asc')`). Original was (`userId ASC, startTime ASC, endTime ASC`) but query is now on `endTime`.*

        *   **`maintenanceRequests` collection:**
            *   `resourceId (Ascending), dateReported (Descending)`
                *   *Purpose: For viewing maintenance requests associated with a specific resource, sorted by report date.*
            *   `status (Ascending), dateReported (Descending)`
                *   *Purpose: For filtering maintenance requests by status and sorting them by report date.*
            *   `assignedTechnicianId (Ascending), dateReported (Descending)`
                *   *Purpose: For viewing maintenance requests assigned to a specific technician, sorted by report date.*

        *   **`notifications` collection:**
            *   `userId (Ascending), createdAt (Descending)`
                *   *Purpose: For users to view their notifications, sorted by creation time.*
        
        *   **`labMemberships` collection (NEW):**
            *   `userId (Ascending), status (Ascending)`
                *   *Purpose: For users to see their active lab memberships and pending requests on their dashboard.*
            *   `labId (Ascending), status (Ascending)`
                *   *Purpose: For admins to list members or pending requests for a specific lab.*
            *   `status (Ascending), requestedAt (Ascending)`
                *   *Purpose: For admins to view a system-wide list of pending lab access requests, ordered by when they were requested.*
            *   `userId (Ascending), labId (Ascending)`
                *   *Purpose: To quickly check if a specific user has any type of membership (active, pending, etc.) for a specific lab.*

        *   **A Note on Index Creation Links:** If Firestore errors with "The query requires an index" and provides a link, **use that link**. It will pre-configure the index exactly as Firestore's query planner needs it.

7.  **Run the Development Server:**
    ```bash
    # Important: Restart your server after setting/changing environment variables!
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    ```
    The application will be available at `http://localhost:9002`.

## Deployment

This application is configured to be easily deployable on platforms like [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) (which is recommended for Next.js projects). Connect your Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket) to Vercel, and it will typically auto-detect the Next.js settings. Remember to configure your Firebase environment variables (from your `.env.local` file, including the Admin SDK credentials) in Vercel's project settings.
